The graphs illustrate a consistent upward trend in both orders and sales from 2011 to 2014. The first graph shows that the number of orders increased steadily each year, with a noticeable jump between 2013 and 2014. The second graph indicates that sales have also risen yearly, paralleling the increase in orders. However, while sales have grown significantly, profit margins have shown a more gradual increase, suggesting that while the volume of business expanded, the profit growth was more modest. Overall, the data reflects a strong period of growth for the company during these years.
